# Bougie

A tiny, sparking terminal based Gopher browser.

Bougie is an open source, cross-platform Gopher & Gemini client for the terminal. It's written in Go and uses the Bubbletea TUI framework.

Bougie is a love letter to the "smolweb", a movement promoting practical, small-scale Internet networking, small servers with low system requirements, as well as small user communities.

Bougie is a personal passion project, and an ode to the open source spirit.
